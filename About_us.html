            <img id="boy" src="francois.jpg">


            <p class="Story">The story of our bakery begins in the 1950s, in post WWII France where a young boy named
                Francois Baguette lived
                in poverty with just his mom to make ends meet. You see, Francois’ dad had died heroically as a
                resistance
                fighter against the German occupation. Although Francois and his mom didn’t have much, every year she
                would buy
                him a slice of cake for his birthday, and they would share it together by candlelight in their small
                apartment.
                For Francois, this was the sweetest memory. Later, Francois and his mother moved to Quebec and started a
                new
                life together. When Francois turned 30, his mom tragically died, and he was devastated! But as he looked
                back at
                the time they shared together; he remembered those special moments where they shared cake by
                candlelight. This
                inspired Francois to open a bakery, in Ottawa, where he dreamed of letting others share in these special
                moments!</p>
